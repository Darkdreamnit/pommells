                <h1>What is seo in digital marketing? Full Guide</h1>
                <p>Digital Marketing is the method of advertising using various online platforms. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) has become a significant aspect of Digital Marketing, as search engines have become the primary means of finding information. 
                    In simple terms, SEO optimizes websites for search engines like Google, Yahoo!, Bing, etc. By being listed higher on SERP’s, website owners can get more traffic and improve their sales.</p>

<h2>SEO in Digital Marketing</h2>
<p>The main aim of any company is to attract customers and increase its revenue. SEO helps companies to connect with potential customers. Search engine optimization can be considered as a way of increasing visibility of a website or blog in natural search results. Any business that wishes to reach targeted audience should definitely consider this technique.</p>

<h2>What is SEO?</h2>
<p>In general, SEO is a term used to describe the methods applied to optimize web content and make it visible on major search engines. A good example is if someone goes to Google.com, types in “dentist near me”, and clicks on the first result. There they go! If anyone wants to find out where the best local dentist is located, he/she would type this keyword in the search bar.</p>

<p>As soon as the user enters the query (keyword), the search engine displays the list of searched pages in order of relevance. These are the pages related to the selected keyword. The page that appears at the top of the list is known as the organic search result. This is how SEO works. To rank high, the page must have keywords that match the search queries. It may seem overwhelming at first but once you understand what SEO experts do, you can enjoy the benefits.</p>


<h3>How does SEO work?</h3>
<p>When someone searches for a particular topic, the search engine sends out a number of signals indicating the importance of the site. These signals are called ranking factors. Ranking factors can be classified into two categories: technical and non-technical. Technical ranking factors are the ones that determine whether a particular site performs well or not. Non-Technical ranking factors are those things that influence the popularity of a site. Both kinds of factors affect how popular a site is.</p>

<h3>Why Should You Use SEO?</h3>
Before we discuss about the advantages of SEO, let us briefly take a look at what the competitors are doing.

Let's say you own a small hotel in a rural area. Without having internet access, it will be hard for you to advertise your hotel. However, if you want to compete with bigger hotels that have internet connections, then you need to use SEO. Now, imagine that you create a page dedicated to your hotel. When people start searching for hotels nearby, they end up on your page. That's the power of SEO.

<h2>How To Maximize Your Digital Marketing Efforts?</h2>
<ul>

<li><b>Content Strategy & Planning</b></li>

<p>Content marketing campaigns use content (text, images, video, audio) to attract website visitors. Once they’ve visited your site, you need to capture their attention and make sure that they stay long enough to convert them into customers. In order to do this, you need to develop a strategy first. This includes deciding what type of content you want to create, how often you’ll produce these pieces, where they should live on your site, who they should go out to and how you’re going to get people to notice them.</p>

<li><b>SEO</b></li>

<p>Search Engine Optimization is the process of optimizing your website to rank higher in search results and increase traffic. SEO is done through a variety of methods including keyword research, page title optimization, social sharing, backlinks, etc., and it involves a lot of trial-and-error. You can hire a company to perform SEO services, but that comes at a cost. An alternative is to learn how to do it yourself. If you don’t have any technical knowledge, start off by signing up for a free WordPress account and installing a plugin called Yoast. Then follow these steps:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create a custom post for each page/post type on your blog (e.g. home, about us, contact). Make sure you give each individual post a unique permalink URL by using post slugs instead of “home” or “contact”.</li>

<li>Add a few keywords to the page title, image alt text and meta description. Make sure you use a keyword in the file name.</li>

<li>Start building links manually. Try finding relevant blogs and websites that cover similar topics to yours and send them a message requesting an interview or guest article. Or try contacting sites directly if you think they'd be interested in writing about you.</li>

</ul>

<li><b>Social Media Marketing</b></li>

<p>Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+, Reddit, YouTube, Twitch, Snapchat, Tumblr and others are an effective way to reach a wide range of potential customers. These platforms offer great promotional opportunities for businesses looking to promote their products or services.</p>

<li><b>Email Marketing</b></li>

<p>Email marketing is still one of the best ways to reach a broad audience without spending a ton of money. By sending emails regularly, you can keep in touch with current and potential customers, build relationships with them and nurture those relationships over time. There is no limit to the number of contacts you can add to your list, making email marketing one of the most powerful online advertising tools around.</p>

<li><b>Analytics</b></li>

<p>Using analytics software like Google Analytics is the easiest way to track how many website visitors you receive daily, weekly, monthly and annually. It also lets you know which pages are getting the most visits, which ones aren’t being viewed as much and what kind of information users click on or leave before visiting your site again.</li>

</ul>

<h3>How does google make its money?</h3>
<ul>

    <li><b>Adsense</b></li>
    
    <p>Google makes money off of their vast network of websites using the Adsense program, which places advertisements on web pages. They then generate revenue whenever someone clicks on these ads.</p>
    
    <li><b>DoubleClick</b></li>
    
    <p>Doubleclick is another type of advertising company that helps businesses make money online by placing advertisements on other sites across the internet. Like Google's ad network, they use cookies to track people's activities on various websites.</p>
    
    <li><b>Affiliate Marketing</b></li>
    
    <p>Affiliate marketing programs work similarly to referral programs, where users refer friends (or complete strangers) to certain companies or products, and if those people purchase something at that business. When someone buys something, the affiliate gets a cut of the profit.</p>
    
    <li><b>Remarketing</b></li>
    
    <p>Remarketing occurs when companies show targeted ads to individuals who have visited their website in order to convert them into customers.</p>
    
    <li><b>Monetization</b></li>
    
    <p>Monetization is making money directly from the product rather than just the sale. An example includes selling t-shirts and posters featuring your artwork. Another method would be to make music videos to promote your band.</p>
    
    <li><b>Search Advertising</b></li>
    
    Search advertising involves displaying ads based on what keywords people enter into search engines. Keywords related to your business might include your name, your brand, your product, etc.
    
    <li><b>Text Ads</b></li>
    
    <p>Text ads are simply static text advertisements that appear somewhere on a page. These are often seen in blogs, news articles, emails, etc.</p>
    
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How Do Search Engines Work?</h3>
    <ul>
    
    <li><b>Google</b></li>
    
    <p>Google's search engine works by crawling the web pages and indexing them. Each page has links to other websites and each link has its own URL (Uniform Resource Locator). These URLs are then inputted into the search box and indexed according to a set of rules. When someone types something into the search box, the results appear instantly. The order that the results appear in is based on what they are related to and how frequently people visit those sites. If you want to find out what someone else searched for, go to www.google.com/history, type in the search term in quotation marks, and hit enter.</p>
    
    <li><b>Bing</b></li>
    
    <p>Bing's search engine works differently than Google's. Instead of spidering the entire web, Bing crawls only selected websites. The order that the pages show up in is determined by how often Bing visits the site. If you don't have any money to spend on advertising, you can buy keywords. 3. Yahoo's search engine works similarly to both Google and Bing. Once you're in the top ten, look at the number and make sure it isn't higher than yours. Then check back every month.</p>
    
    <li><b>Ask</b></li>
    
    <p> Ask's search engine works completely different from the others. It searches through user questions and answers instead of searching the Internet. Click on the "Who's Online" tab, fill out your information, and wait for an e-mail notification from ask.yahoo.com.</p>
    
    <li><b>DuckDuckGo</b></li>
    
    <p>DuckDuckGo's search engine does not crawl anything. It uses a system called the "spiderless web." This means that when users type a word into the search bar, text and images are pulled directly from the websites themselves. Because there is no spidering, the results are ordered by relevance and popularity. Users can customize their search results by adding filters such as location, date range, and language.</p>
    
    <h2>What Are Paid And Organic Search</h2>
    <ul>
    
    <li><b>Paid search ads</b></li>
    
    <p>Paid advertisements are those that people click on, and they show up alongside organic (free) search results. You’ll see them appear at the top or bottom of Google search pages. These ads generally cost money — either per click or per impression. An ad might say “Get $100 Free + More!” or “Order Now!” If you click on these ads, you’ll go to websites that advertise products or services.</p>
    
    <li><b>Organic search ads</b></li>
    
    <p>Organic search ads aren’t paid advertisements in the traditional sense. Instead, they appear above or below organic results on Google and other search engines based on your search query. Unlike paid search ads, organic search ads don’t direct you to any specific website; instead, they give you information about the searcher’s intent. For example, if someone searches for “best gluten-free bread recipes,” an organic search ad for a blog post might display that content above organic results.</p>
    
    <p>Organic search can be valuable if you want to attract web visitors to your site who haven’t previously been exposed to you and convert them into paying customers. But making sure that your website appears organically near the top of page 1 of Google isn’t cheap. That said, organic search provides long-term value. Because your site naturally attracts repeat visitors and customer attention, it builds trust among consumers over time.</p>
    
    <li><b>Display advertising</b></li>
    
    <p>Display advertising occurs when your business name and/or logo is displayed in a sponsored link, box, or banner on a third party website. Display networks, like Facebook, Twitter, Bing Ads, and Yahoo! PPC, offer sponsorships that help connect businesses to relevant audiences. These ads often run on websites such as social networking sites, news articles and blogs, product and service review sites, and so forth.</p>
    
    <p>A great way to get started is to create free accounts on various online marketing tools and platforms. To save yourself some money, you can use different accounts to test out the different types of campaigns on each tool to find what works best for you. Once you have tested everything out on a certain platform, then you can upgrade to a premium account on that same tool.</p>
    
    <p>You may not know how to do every aspect of digital marketing, but having some knowledge of SEO fundamentals makes you well-equipped work with clients and colleagues on projects. A solid understanding of SEO helps you become more effective by improving the accuracy of your keywords and phrases, and allows you to keep up with changing SEO trends.</p>
    
    <p>Once you’ve defined your target audience, picked a keyword they’re likely using, and developed a plan for getting traffic to your site, it’s time to start building those links. Link building can take time, so you need patience and persistence to build your authoritative backlinks. Eventually, you'll reach the point where URLs of major publishers, high-authority blogs, and trusted directories begin to carry your brand's weight. For the first 200 words in the article, the quality of writing was pretty good. After that, I saw a drop in quality.</p>
    
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What are Visibility And Rankings</h2>
    <h3>Visibility</h3>
    <p>Visibility is basically how search engines view your site. When you publish content, it's visible to everyone, but if no one ever sees it then they cannot rank it. Ranking is essentially where your website appears on a search engine results page (SERP). You want your site to appear at the top, ideally first page. Here are some ways you can increase your visibility and rankings.</p>
    
    <ul>
    
    <li><b>Post great content</b></li>
    
    <p>You have to write quality content. If you do not put time into writing high-quality content for your audience than you won't get anywhere. Content marketing is extremely important for SEO and you should invest as much time as possible into producing unique content.</p>
    
    <li><b>Optimize your titles</b></li>
    
    <p>Titles play a huge role in SEO and they're often overlooked. Titles are what people type into the search bar to find your sites, so make sure they are relevant and engaging. Use keywords in your title.</p>
    
    <li><b>Improve your backlinks</b></li>
    
    <p>If you want to improve your ranking, you need to build links back to your site. These could be external links or internal links depending on where you are trying to go. If you own a local business, try building links to your site.</p>
    
    <li><b>Make sure your URL is optimized</b></li>
    
    <p>Your URL should be short and specific. Search engines love long URLs because they know exactly what everything is about. Avoid using numbers or symbols, they don't help anything.</p>
    
    <li><b>Create a sitemap</b></li>
    
    <p>Sitemaps give search engines a summary of your entire site. They tell them what pages are on your site, images included, and any videos. It helps search engines crawl your site more efficiently.</p>
    
    <li><b>Submit your site to Google</b></li>
    
    <p>Google wants to help users find good content online and create a seamless user experience, but sometimes their algorithms can cause issues. They are constantly updating their algorithm so it's always best to submit your site to Google so they can continue to optimize your site for users.</p>
    
    <li><b>Rankings</b></li>
    <p>Rankings in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) are essentially the way Google ranks websites and how they show up in search results. There are many factors involved in rankings including page content, backlinks, domain age, and much more. To put it simply, higher rankings mean more traffic to a particular website.</p>
    
    </ul>
    
    <b>A quick explanation of what each ranking means:</b>
    
    <ul>
    
    
    
    <li>These are the top 10 results displayed when searching for a given keyword.</li>
    
    <li>These are the top 20 results displayed when searching for keywords.</li>
    
    <li>These are the top 30 results displayed when searching for key words.</li>
    
    <li>These are the top 40 results displayed when searching for some keywords.</li>
    
    <li>These are the top 50 results displayed when searching for certain keywords.</li>
    
    </ul>
