                <h1>Keyword Competitive Research | What Is it?</h1>
                <p>Keyword competition research (KCR) is an excellent way to get insight into what people type into search engines about your product/service. Keywords are usually divided up into broad categories based on
                     how they perform for your site. You may have heard phrases like PPC keywords, SEO keywords, conversion rate optimization (CRO), etc. KCR is the method of collecting these phrases and finding out
                      exactly what people are searching for. A good example would be if you sell dog food online. People might search for “dog food”, “puppy food”, ‘best puppy food’, ‘cheap puppy food’, etc. 
                      Then you could use KCR to find out what people are actually typing into Google searches.</p>
                      <br>
                     <p>There are many ways you can gather data using KCR but I am going to go over three methods.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Method One</b> - Using Google AdWords Keyword Tool</li>

<p>Google offers a free tool called the AdWords Keyword Tool, which allows you to easily build lists of keywords. Simply input your URL into the tool and select “Search Traffic Estimator” under the Keyword Research tab. Once you enter your domain name, hit Search and start typing your chosen keywords. You should then see a list of relevant terms appear. If you want to take this further, you can add any of those terms to your campaigns and learn more about them.</p>

<li><b>Method Two</b> – Using Bing Ads Keyword Tool</li>

<p>Bing ads offer the same functionality as the previous tool but are slightly different. You simply need to click on the “Keyword Ideas” link at the top of the page. From here, you can choose the countries you wish to target, the number of keywords you want to collect, and whether you wish to run the keyword report daily or weekly. Once you’re done, you’ll receive a spreadsheet of suggested keywords organized by category.</p>

<li><b>Method Three</b> – Using SEMrush.com Keyword Explorer</li>

<p>SEMrush offers several tools for generating keyword ideas. First, you’ll want to navigate to their “Keyword Explorer” section. Here, you can create a custom search with specific criteria and a time frame. Enter your keywords into the box, set the country you’d like to target, and the date range you’d like information for. Hit Go and you'll receive a list of results that match your criteria. Select the ones you like and copy the URLs.</p>

<p>Once you have these lists, you can export the results to Excel and sort them into the categories you listed above. You can also download the CSV file directly into a database so you have access to all your data in one place.</p>

<p>The best thing about this KCR is that it saves you from having to constantly do this work for yourself! That said, if you’re not really familiar with this stuff, it can still be a bit tedious. However, once you get comfortable doing it, it will save a lot of time in the long term.</p>

</ul>

<h2>How To Analyze Keyword Competition</h2>
<ol>

<li><b>What is the average monthly search volume?</b></li>

<p>We have seen some estimates that say there are about 1 billion searches per month. I think this number is only accurate if you consider US-based people searching. If we look at global searches then the numbers could easily go higher than one billion searches per month.</p>

<li><b>How many competing websites are listed for each keyword?</b></li>

<p>You should start looking at how many sites are currently ranking for each keyword for a given phrase. You can use our SEO tools to get started.</p>

<li><b>Are any of these competitors dead links?</b></li>

<p>If they’re not, check their backlinks. Most likely they are using link building services like HYIPs (High Yield Investment Programs). These programs pay out daily profits. There can be quite a few links pointing to a single website. So you might want to analyze those links too.</p>

<li><b>Is the site mobile friendly?</b></li>

<p>Are they optimized for mobile devices? Remember Google recently announced they would rank sites based on mobile friendliness.</p>

<li><b>Has the website been indexed by search engines?</b></li>

<p>Search engine indexing is when all the information is copied from a website onto a database. This database is then accessible by search engines. Make sure your website is properly indexed.</p>

<h2>Why You Need To Do Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p>Competitive analysis identifies the competitors' strengths and weaknesses, giving us insight into how they operate and what marketing strategies they use. We then take these insights and apply them to our own business, and finally implement them in order to beat their strategies.</p>

<h2>Seo Competitive Analysis Tools</h2>
<ol>

<li><b>Google Keyword Planner</b></li>

<p>Google keyword planner is the first place to start if you’re aiming to optimize keywords and phrases for search engines. You can use their free tool to find out what people are searching for and how much competition they have. You can even check what other companies focus on before making your own decisions. You’ll get instant results and real data about what words or phrases are generating traffic and revenue without spending any money.</p>

<li><b>SEMrush</b></li>

<p>SEMrush is a powerful SEO tool that lets you analyze and discover your competitors' backlinks, top pages, social mentions, etc. Use it to track keyword trends, discover influencers, and uncover opportunities for link building and content creation. You can do complex searches using different filters (industry, location, topic) or search for specific links. Once you've done your research, you'll also receive detailed information about your competitor's performance that can help you decide where to spend your time and effort.</p>

<li><b>MozBar</b></li>

<p>The Mozbar is a chrome extension that gives you real-time SEO insights. You're able to see things like organic rankings, SERP analysis, link building opportunities, backlink profiles, and more. Find out what keywords they rank for and determine if they should be optimized. If you want to know what keywords to target then this is definitely worth checking out.</p>

<li><b>Ahrefs</b></li>

<p>Ahrefs is not only my favorite SEO software but also a great way to learn about the internet. With its unique visualization tools, you'll be able to understand the algorithm behind the digital world we live in. Its deep learning algorithms give you tons of information about your website. Ahrefs shows you who linked to you, how many times, how many pages were shared, how many shares are left, etc.</p>

<li><b>Keywords Everywhere</b></li>
<p>
    Keywords Everywhere (KE) is a free resource that shows you keywords on-the-fly as you type them. KE displays similar results from Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo. Simply enter some text, press enter, and see keywords appear, including synonyms and variations.
</p>
<li><b>SimilarWeb</b></li>

<p>Similar Web is a great tool to measure backlinks, organic traffic, and user engagement. What makes them special is that they show you the importance of each channel for your business. In addition, they offer a full package for paid campaigns and offers advanced features like domain age and gender breakdown. They provide you with a complete overview of all the traffic that comes to your site.</p>

<h2>Identifying Softer Target Competitors</h2>
<h3>How do I find my competitors?</h3>

<p>The first step in identifying what kind of soft seo target competitor you have is determining who those competitors are. You should know if you’re competing against a local business or nationwide company. If they’re local, then you need to determine whether their focus is on attracting customers locally or nationally. Finding out these things helps you determine how your own business compares to them.</p>

<h3>What websites should I use to identify my competition?</h3>

<p>The second step in identifying your soft seo target competitor's website is using Google Analytics to look at the websites your soft seo target competitors are ranking for. In this case, we’ll be looking at Google rankings. There are numerous ways to access Google Analytics, but the best way is to use the free version. By entering your URL here, you get a list of keywords that people typed in to find your site. From here, you can see where your website ranks for each keyword, such as 10, 20, 30, etc. Then, you should take a look at where your top competitors rank. Look at the sites that rank for similar phrases and see if you see any patterns. This may give you a clue about what keywords your competitors are targeting and how your business’s strategy might need to change.</p>

<h3>Where do I even begin finding competitors?</h3>

<p>Once you’ve narrowed down your potential competitors and seen some trends, it’s time to go back and start analyzing your own website. Take note of the pages that are getting searched often for your product/service. Once you know what keywords your competitors are ranking for, make sure you’re on page 1 of search results.</p>

<h3>How can I track my competitors' performance?</h3>

<p>The final step in identifying your soft SEO target competitors is tracking their progress. To keep track of the number of times visitors came from certain links, you can set cookies. Cookies save information about users' online activities. When a person returns to your website after being away, you can analyze the cookies to see which link brought them back.</p>

<h3>What tools can help me monitor my competitors?</h3>

<p>There are many tools out there that can show you exactly what keywords your competitors are searching for and to see which ones bring them traffic. Popular software include Google Alerts, SpyFu, Alexa, Webmaster Tools, Google Trends, and Moz Pro. These tools can help you stay on top of your competition by providing live updates of the search terms they’re using. Additionally, they allow you to create alerts that notify you whenever a competitor uses a word or phrase you want to promote.</p>

<h2>Backlink Data Is Powerful For Seo</h2>
<b>Backlinking</b>

<p>When you have backlinks to your website, it’s likely that Google will rank you higher than sites without these links. However, backlinks are not just about rankings. You need to know what kind of links will help your site get noticed by search engines. In this article we will talk about the importance of high quality backlinks to increase SEO.</p>

<b>How to create backlinks</b>

<p>There are many ways to build backlinks to your business website; however, building backlinks organically is the best way to do so. When you buy backlinks from low-quality websites, they may actually hurt your ranking. To avoid doing this, make sure you use only high-quality websites (and directories) to promote your business online.</p>

<b>Which type of backlinks work?</b>

<p>The best types of backlinks are incoming links from authoritative websites. These links indicate that a website trusts your content or authority. If they link to you, then it means Google recognizes your content. Here are some examples of good backlinks:</p>

<ul>

<li>Articles from popular news websites</li>

<li>Blog posts written by other professional websites</li>

<li>Reviews posted by other websites</li>

<li>Images uploaded to stock photo websites</li>

<li>Press releases submitted to PR publications</li>

</ul>

<b>What should I look for in a backlink?</b>

<p>

To find good quality backlinks, you need to look at the domain authority and PageRank. Domain Authority represents how trustworthy a website is based on the number of votes that website receives. You want to purchase domains with high DA - a domain with a high DA generally indicates that the website has a lot of traffic since it's receiving many votes. A page's PageRank is a measure of how relevant a web page is. You want to purchase pages with a high PR - a page with a high PR means that the page contains valuable information that users would want to read.

</p>
<h2>What are long-tail keywords in seo?</h2>
<p>
    Long tail keywords in SEO are a set of related words that people use to search online. A good example would be a keyword phrase that includes the words “best” and “cannabis.” These phrases have been researched to show how many people search for them each year, as well as what sort of searches they perform. In addition to this information, companies want to know what terms related to their products or services are being searched for. These types of keywords are known as long-tail keywords because they tend to be longer than normal keywords.
     Long-tail keywords are often easier to rank organically because they help provide context to the search term. This lets Google understand what the user was looking for and helps the company's website appear higher in relevant results.
</p>

    <h6 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
    <p>
        Competitive keyword research is extremely beneficial because it shows how to find keywords that are related but still popular in your niche or industry. This type of research will help you to figure out where the best place is to focus your SEO efforts in your article so that you can compete with big brands and corporations, all while getting the biggest click-through-rate possible.
