                <h1>Seo Keyword Search | How to Optimize Your SEO for Free</h1>
                <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. This is the process of planning your website, blog, and other online properties so that search engines like Google will find them as result when users type queries into their web browsers. If your SEO suffers from an abundance of bad links, or you don’t perform routine keyword research to optimize your site for specific search phrases, you may struggle to gain visibility in search results. Fortunately, implementing effective SEO practices can be as easy as making a few simple changes. Keywords are the building blocks of every successful SEO strategy. Without keywords, there is no way for a user to find your site on the Internet. Therefore, ensuring that your keywords are present and They Are Meaningful are two essential elements of any effective SEO strategy.</p>
<br>


                <h2>What Are SEO Keywords?</h2>
                <p>Keywords are words and phrases that represent your product or service. If a user types a query into their web browser, your keywords will be the first thing that appear on the screen. Therefore, the words that appear in your headlines and description are also an important part of your SEO strategy. Keywords should be present in every aspect of your site. In other words, they shouldn’t just be keywords, but They Are Also Important to Your SEO and Your Visitors, too. Therefore, keyword research is the process of determining and selecting the best keywords for your site. This process may seem like an easy task, but it’s actually one of the most challenging aspects of all SEO. Beyond choosing the best keywords for your product or service, your keyword research is equally important for your site’s word rank. As your site’s ranking factor, keyword rank is just as important as choosing the best keywords for your site.</p>
                
                <h2>Put Your Keywords To Work</h2>
                <p>Keyword research is one of the first steps towards getting your brand noticed online. If you don't know how to work them, then you're missing out on tons of potential customers who could benefit from what you have to offer.</p>
                
                <p>The best way to find out if people are searching for what you're offering is to use Google's keyword tool. You can create your own list of keywords or choose from their database of millions of existing searches. This free tool will allow you to track both daily and monthly search volumes for any given keyword. Not only that, but you'll also gain access to a set of competing websites where you can get a sense of just how well your competitors rank for each term you care about.</p>
                
                <b>So, how do you make sure you're using these tools effectively? Here are some tips:</b>
                
                <ul>
                
                <li><b>Use the right terms</b> - Don't overuse terms that aren't specific enough to accurately describe your niche. A good example would be something like 'how to start a blog'. While this may sound useful, it isn't really specific enough. Instead, try looking for phrases that help explain your brand, product, or service, rather than generic words that won't give you much traffic at all.</lI>
                
                <li><b>Keep it short</b> - When you're conducting keyword research, keep in mind that people tend to type less frequently than they speak. Try to limit the length of your keyword list to no more than three or four terms - anything longer and people might start to lose focus.</li>
                
                <li><b>Include variations</b> - Do you sell products? Use different terms for each variation. For example, if you sell T-shirts, you might want to look for words like 'grey', 'black', and 'red' instead of just 'red'. Or if you sell hats, you might want to add 'beanies' and 'pullovers'.</li>
                
                <li><b>Take advantage of long tail keywords</b> - Long tail keywords are those that end in a question mark or a wildcard character. For example, 'where do I buy a beanie?' These types of queries are extremely popular among consumers and provide great opportunities for SEO.</p>
                
                <li><b>Think globally</b> - Make sure you're not limiting yourself to just domestic markets - consider adding international keywords that focus on countries outside of America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
                
                </ul>
                
                <p>Once you've completed your keyword research, it's time to determine whether or not these keywords are relevant to your business model. There are many ways you can go about doing this, but here are two quick and simple methods:</p>
                
                <ul>
                
                <li>Compare your domain name to the keywords you've selected. If these keywords appear anywhere inside your domain name, you should take note of them.</li>
                
                <li>Set up Google alerts for your keywords. As soon as someone enters your phrase in Google (or whatever search engine you prefer), you'll receive an email telling you that you had a hit. From there, you can either respond to the inquiry directly or pass along the information to your team.</li>
                
                </ul>
                
                <p>Now that you've done your keyword research, it’s time to figure out how to put them to work.</p>
                
                <h2>How To Find New Keywords?</h2>
                <p>The first step is finding topics that people are searching for online. You want to find keywords that get people clicking away from other websites and onto yours. Here are some tips on how to do just that.
                
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                
                <li><b>Use Google Trends</b></li>
                
                <p>You may have heard about Google's search trends before, but what if I told you that you could use them to find out what people are looking for? Check it out below:</p>
                
                <p>Now, go ahead and type in your keyword here, for example “how to start a blog”. After typing in the text, click on the dropdown menu where it says “Select date range”. Choose from today to last year, then select whatever month you would like (I chose September). Finally, hit the button that says “Get Trending Searches”. Now, all you need to do is wait until the results show. You will notice something called a line graph, which shows you what search terms were popular throughout the selected time period.</p>
                
                <p>This tool is great if you want to know what people are really interested in right now, rather than what they searched for years ago. Try using it for current events, news articles, or anything else that interests you!</p>
                
                <li><b>Use Social Media Data</b></li>
                
                <p>Social media data is a great way to gather information about what people are searching online. These data can help you determine what kinds of information people are seeking out and whether or not there are any common issues being addressed across the web. If you have accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc.
                
                <li><b>Google Keyword Planner</b></li>
                
                <p>Keyword Planner is a free tool that helps users find relevant keywords using Google's search engine results pages (SERPs). First, let's take a look at how to use the basic version of the tool.</p>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                
                <li>Step 1 - Go to www.google.com/keywordPlanner and enter the topic you want to research in the Search bar. Click Next and then choose whether you would like to do broad match, phrase match, or exact match. Choose broad match if you're looking to increase the number of visitors to your website. If you're looking to get traffic from local searches, choose phrase match. Exact match is ideal if you're trying to target a specific geographic area.</li>
                
                <li>Step 2 - Add your keyword(s) to the Keywords box. You can add as many keywords as you need to.</li>
                
                <li>Step 3 - Set the location of your business and click Save.</li>
                
                <b>You'll now have access to a list of keywords you can use in the future.</b>
                </ol>

                <h2>Research Your Keywords & Prioritize</h2>
                <ol>

                    <li>Researching keywords is the first step towards getting traffic to your website. When people search online they type words into a search engine. These words are called keywords. You want to make sure these keywords are relevant to your content and that they’re high-quality.</li>
                    
                    <li>Once you have your list of keywords, prioritize them based on their relevancy and competition. Relevancy means how closely your keyword matches what you're selling. Competition refers to how many websites are already ranking for the same keyword. A higher number of competitors indicates a lower chance of ranking well for that particular keyword.</li>
                    <li>After prioritizing your keywords, create a spreadsheet where you enter each keyword along with its associated URL. Then use a tool like SEMrush to find the average monthly searches per month and the difficulty level of the keyword.</lI>

                        <li>Use the information you gathered from the previous steps to determine how much money you should invest in each keyword. You can do this by multiplying the monthly searches times the cost per click (CPC).</lI>
                        
                        <li>Once you've determined how much you should spend on each keyword, divide that amount by the total number of keywords you entered into your spreadsheet. This gives you an average CPC for each keyword.</li>
                        
                        <li>Now that you know the average CPC for each keyword, go back to your spreadsheet and add up the numbers. This is the total investment you need to make for each keyword.</li>
                        
                        <li>Next, take the total investment and multiply it by the number of keywords you entered. This is the total amount of money you'll need to allocate for SEO.</li>
                        
                        <li>Finally, set aside some funds for future updates. This way you won't have to worry about updating your site if you decide to change something later on.</li>
                        
                        </ol>

    <h6 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
    <p>
        Keyword research is beneficial for websites, regardless of their size. It doesn't matter if you run a sprawling empire that has gone global, or a niche blog that targets a specific audience - all of your efforts to optimize your website will mean little if you aren't catering to users' needs. To cater to users' needs, it's important to keep them in mind at all times. Your users are the most important part of your business or organization because without them, you wouldn't exist. Keyword research gives you an idea of who your users
         are and what they're looking for when they visit your site. With this information, you can then create content, which is optimized for the reader, rather than targeted at the search engines.
